Sample Munhumutapa APIs for Node JS
=============================

The Node JS module performs local signing and encryption using the same code used by the official Munhumutapa wallet.<br>

Therefore:<br>
Your passphrase is never sent to the remote node when submitting a transaction.<br>
Transaction bytes returned by the remote node are parsed and validated against the submitted data.<br>
Encryption is done locally.<br>
<br>
To use the Node JS module:<br>
- Install the Munhumutapa software (no need to download the blockchain)<br>
- Install Node JS and NPM from https://nodejs.org/en/<br>
- From the command prompt type:<br>
npm install <MunhumutapaRoot>/html/www/js<br>
cd node_modules/munhumutapa-blockchain/sample<br>
- Configure the remote node, Munhumutapa account and default chain by editing the config.json file<br>
- Run the samples using Node JS, for example:<br>
node send.money.js<br>

Once installed, the munhumutapa-blockchain package no longer depends on a local Munhumutapa node.<br>
At this time we do not recommend publishing the package to a public NPM repository since there is no way to validate the authenticity of such downloaded package.<br>

Warning:<br>
Your passphrase is submitteed to a remote node only when invoking specific APIs which require the passphrase to operate like startForging API.<br>
We recommend that you do not use these APIs in your Node JS code.<br>
